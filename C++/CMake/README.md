![CMake](../../misc/cmake_logo-main.png)

[CMake]("https://cmake.org/") is a software build system mainly intended to help build C/C++ software. Written by Kitlabs it is open-source software and part of most Linux distributions.   
Many big project use CMake, e.g. KDE or ROS.   
A normal (C-Style) Makefile cannot be considered an alternative, because they usually only contain compile intructions, but not e.g. how to find external packages.
