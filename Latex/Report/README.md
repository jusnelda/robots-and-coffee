Report Template
===============

This is a very basic report template.  

* The `report.tex` file is your framework or scaffolding. It just provides basic structure; this is the file you need to compile.  
* The `style.sty` file is your style file, here you put in all the packages you want to use and some settings for your file e.g. language, line spacing etc.  
* The [tex](tex) folder contains a file for each chapter, so it's all modular and still easy to handle if your report gets very long.  
* Images go in the [img](img) folder.
