LaTeX
=====

Here you can find some Latex inspiration.  
In the [Templates](Templates) folder are simple and easy to use frameworks, so you can get started with your docoument right away.  
I like writing the text in vim and then compiling and editing in [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/). - You decide what works best for you.
